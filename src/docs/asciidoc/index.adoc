== Agenda

* Basics needed for a demo
* Processing
* Rocket & Moonlander
* General tips

== Demo basics

[%step]
* Graphics
* Music
* Graphics usually in sync with music
* Last few minutes (~ 1-4)
+
NOTE: These vary depending competition rules and categories


== Processing
* https://processing.org/ "Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts."
* Free & Open source
* Works on major PC platforms

== Processing Basics
//TODO maybe a picture of the UI here?

* IDE-like environment for writing/compiling/running sketches
* Has own simple Java-ish programming language
** Processing internally transforms/compiles/runs it as Java code
* Good references and examples https://processing.org/reference/

== Sketch structure

[source, java]
----

//Global variables here

void settings() {
	// used if parameters used for size function
}

void setup() {
	// one-time setup called at the start
}

void draw() {
	// called repeatedly, draw one frame
}
----

== global variables
* Imports go before these (e.g. `import moonlander.library.*;`)
* Useful for constants
* Used when a variable needed in both setup and draw


== settings function
* New in Processing 3.x
* Used if using variables for the size() function parameters

[source, java]
----
// These control how big the opened window is.
// Before you release your demo, set these to 
// full HD resolution (1920x1080).
int CANVAS_WIDTH = 480;
int CANVAS_HEIGHT = 360;

void settings(){
	size(CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT, P2D );
}
----

== setup function
* Called once per sketch before draw
* Used to initialize systems
** Setup fps, Moonlander etc. (explained later)

[source, java]
----
void setup(){
	frameRate(60);
	...
	moonlander = Moonlander.initWithSoundtrack(...);
	moonlander.start();
}
----

== draw function
* Draw one frame to the screen
* Normally the first line clear the screen
** Can be left out for interesting effects

[source, java]
----
void draw(){
	background(0);
	moonlander.update(); //needs to be called every frame
	...
}
----

== Rocket

[%step]
* General problem: How to sync music into graphics?
* Solution: Make demo as a function of time and use a tracker
* -> Rocket https://github.com/rocket/rocket
* Integration to Processing done via Moonlander library https://github.com/anttihirvonen/moonlander


== Rocket

[%step]
* Live editing numeric values for variables at time instants
* Can move forward and backwards in time while running
* Define interpolations between defined values
* Read values to Processing via Moonlander
* Configuration can be saved as a file to be run without Rocket

== Installing moonlander
* First install Minim dependency
** Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library
* Download Moonlander and unzip to your Sketchbook location
** File -> Preferences "Sketchbook location"
** (libraries subfolder, next to minim folder)

== Music
* Use music that you have created yourself or have a license/permission to use
* Making it yourself will give you more control, but the learning workload might be outside the scope of the event
* In both cases, you'll need the tempo BPM number (Beats Per Minute) for Moonlander

== Music cont'd
* For free music Google "Royalty free music" and/or "Creative Commons music"
* Check the license and make required attributions

NOTE: In practice choose something that is Creative Commons (CC) and mention in the credits

WARNING: Do not use CC-ND (Creative Commons "No Derivates")

== Music - List of sites
* https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html
* http://freemusicarchive.org

== Tips

[%step]
* Start at http://www.graffathon.fi/2018/getting-started/
* Use version control (e.g. Git), or at least backups
* Make something you can submit first, improve later
* Doublecheck the final version is correct one
* Have fun :)

== Tips - extra
* Code everything as function of time
* Code everything resolution independent
* Needs to look good only on compo machine
* Effects can be short and can be repeated

== Tips - extra2
* Libraries 
** PeasyCam
** QueasyCam
